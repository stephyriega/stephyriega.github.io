Over the past 30 years, gender-gap on average levels of educational attainment has closed in many developed and more recently in developing countries (Bailey and Dynarski, 2011; Rosenzweig and Zhang, 2013). Nonetheless, the gender gap in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and careers strongly persist (Ellison and Swanson, 2010; Cheryan, 2012; González de San Román and de la Rica Goiricelaya, 2016, Eble and Hu, 2018). Furthermore, STEM gender gaps are more pronounced in developing countries (Jayachandran, 2015). In Africa and Latin America, the gender gap in mathematics achievement tend to favor boys as early as end of primary school (UNESCO, 2017). In this paper, we examine whether an after-school intervention in primary school can improve girls STEM skills and attitudes. 

Recent literature has shown that gender gaps in STEM are not the result of biological factors or innate ability. Rather, evidence suggests that girls’ and women’s participation, achievement and progression in STEM studies and careers are driven by multiple and overlapping factors among which the more salient are: gender stereotypes, role models, and cultural norms that influence parental beliefs and expectations (Coffman, 2016, Eccles, 1998, Eble and Hu, 2018, UNESCO, 2017 among others). Therefore, many countries seek to address the lower participation and learning achievement of girls in STEM education. 

Peru and the MaCTec program are an ideal education setting in which to examine girls’ participation and learning in STEM fields. MaCTec, a non-profit organization funded in 2012 that seeks to eradicate scientific illiteracy in Peru, has been implementing a program, the MaCTec Academy , with the goal of nurturing the curiosity and creativity of Peruvian girls in STEM fields. Each year since 2016, they randomly choose 40 girls (MaCTec scholars) between ages 8 and 11 who applied to participate in a one-year program that consists of weekly workshops with Peruvian scientists working in research and academia. The goal of these workshops is to promote girls’ discovery of nature, science, physics or biology, and demonstrate that women can be successful at STEM careers. 

This paper seeks to answer the following research questions:

1) Can exposure to high-profile scientists (university professors from Peru and the US) during primary school improve girls human capital, aspirations and attitudes as well as change parents’ gender attitudes towards girls? 

2) Do role model impacts persist over time?

We address our research questions using experimental evidence. Conditional on applying, MaCTec selects participants relying on a randomized control trial using a lottery. We are analyzing the 2016-2019 program by matching 2016-2019 applicants (2,800 girls) to the following sources of administrative data: ECE (national standardized test scores), SIAGIE (administrative centralized system that record enrollment, grades by subject, dropout, attendance, student behavior ratings), and SISFOH (demographic census containing information on household characteristics such as income, parents education and occupation, this data will allow us to see heterogeneous effects by families and explore compliers’ characteristics). Therefore, we are able to compare randomized control and treated fellows before and after the intervention. Preliminary findings corroborate the validity of the randomization as baseline socio-demographic and education characteristics (before the intervention) are balanced between selected (treated) and non-selected (control) applicants.

We complement this administrative data by conducting follow up detailed in-depth surveys to parents and girls to measure attitudes, aspiration beliefs and parental investments as well as gender-science implicit association tests. Therefore, by comparing control versus treated girls (and their parents) we will be able to get information on whether the intervention affected aspirations and beliefs. MaCTeC provides a unique intervention as it targets girls at the end of primary school at a critical period before gaps in STEM abilities widen up. The final objective of our project is to learn whether the MaCTec model has the potential to increase girls’ interest and learning in STEM fields and propose an alternative to scale it up at the school level.
