Apart from Economics and coding, I have other interests, too. I love reading, I like practising water sports and, from time to time, I'm fond in creating art in some form. 

## Reading 

I started reading by chance in one break during high school and since then I haven't stopped. As you can see, my topics of interest have changed over time: detective novels, youth literature, latin magical realism,  contemporary fiction and ,recently, modern surrealism. I have also read academic books too, about Economics and Maths, and I feel like both types of books - academic and no academic- have complemented my life.

## Water sports

I have been swimming since I was a child and I have tried to keep this sport it a constant in my life (mostly during summer but in the last few years also during winter) because is one of the activies that helps me to relax. Recently, I have started taking surfing classes and it has been challenging. I have always wanted to master a wave and I think I am in the process to learn how.

## Creating art in some form

Creating art helps me to get a wider perpective of the world we live in. Taking photographs of the places I have been to inmortalice a place and time is one of the forms I have sticked for years but recently had the courage to make it public. Recreating a scene from a book or a moment of my life (through drawing, painting, or making a collage) is also one of the ways I have find to create art in my own way.
