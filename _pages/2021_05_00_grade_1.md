Supported in literature review, elaboration of descriptive tables using Stata and data analysis for a investigation that aimed to detect corruption as non-pecuniary damage using Machine Learning methods.  In order to do this, I replicated  the paper ["Cálculo del tamaño de la corrupción y la inconducta funcional en el Perú"](https://www.gob.pe/institucion/contraloria/informes-publicaciones/1200963-calculo-del-tamano-de-la-corrupcion-y-la-inconducta-funcional-en-el-peru-una-aproximacion-exploratoria) by Shack, Pérez & Portugal (2020), managed  data from the Controlaría General de la República del Perú (CGR) and was in the process of fuzzy-merging it with information from other entities of the peruvian state.
