Hi! I'm Stephy Riega, an Economics BA from PUCP, Peru. My interests are in the field of Applied Microeconomics, Data Science, Labor, Education and Gender. 

I also like listening to music, reading and practicing water sports. I'm a big Taylor Swift, Bon Iver and Phoebe Bridgers fan. Magical realism and detective novels are the kind of books I prefer to read, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Haruki Murakami are on the top of my favourite writers. Furthermore, I have been swimming since I can remember and recently I am taking surfing classes. 

Here you will find more about my research, code and my hobbies.
