Supported in the construction of a synthetic data panel of women in the age to conceveive, analysis of the dataset (tables and graphs) and estimation of a panel event study on the fertility rate in Peru. Our main dataset was built originally from Encuesta Demográfica y de Salud Familiar (ENDES) from 1996 to 2020 and I made use of Stata for this task. 

I estimated the ammount of women who were pregnant by week and month. After reducing the data to go from 2010-2020, I reconstruted some sociodemographic characteristics an pregnant history in order to the construst a synthetic panel with 12 million observations.
