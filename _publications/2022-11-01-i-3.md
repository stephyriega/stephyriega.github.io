Assited in the implementation of the remote project "Real Man Challenge" in Perú, an experimental intervention carried out in partnership with the Ministry of Women and Vulnerable populations of Peru, the World Bank.

Helped in programming the survey and audit instruments in SurveyCTO, as well as the implementation of bench testing and remote pilots. I was part of the team that remote trained and managed the survey field and audit team (~40 surveyors) that conducted the data collections in both the endline collection and its pilot. For the progress review of the data colleted by SCTO of the endline survey and the audit survey, I also created a dashboard in PowerBI.

We used Twilio to send reminders and to collect contact information. For this, I created the flows of messages in the platform and the Python codes that triggers the delivery of them. Also, we used YAPE, PLIN and phone recharges to deliver the incentives to the participants. Lastly, I helped in the elaboration of the slides and to present the results of field collection to the principal investigators.
