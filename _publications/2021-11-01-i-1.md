Assited in the implementation and impact evaluation of the semi-remote project "Empower your mind in family" in El Salvador, an experimental intervention carried out in partnership with the Ministry of Education and BID.

Helped in programming the survey and audit instruments in SurveyCTO, as well as the implementation of bench testing and presential pilots. I was part of the team that remote trained and managed the survey field and audit team that conducted the data collections in both the endline and pilot. 

I also was part in overseeing data collection activities in the on-site pilot, mantaining data quality protocols. Moreover, I was in charge of data quality audits of the endline creating a dashboard in R-Shinny.

Finally, I helped in the elaboration of progress and results reports to PIs and research partners. We used the open answers from the survey to make a Natural Language Process (NPL) analysis, using wordclouds and frequency tables of the words used using SpaCy in Python.
