Assited in the elaboration of estimations and graphs using an RCT dataset related to the impact evaluation of reminders on labour formalization programme in Brazil. I made use of Stata and LateX to this programm the calculations as well as to model the tables and them exported to Latex. I calcuted the heterogenous effects of programmes between clusters, made test to the compare two coefficients of the same estimation and graphed the evolution of the ATE effects in time.
