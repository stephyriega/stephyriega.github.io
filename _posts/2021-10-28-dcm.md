## Applied Statistics: Causal Inference in Economic Analysis and Machine Learning Methods

You can find my repo [here](https://github.com/stephyriega/ML_CI). In this course we develop a series of proyects and replications in R and Python using Machine Learning in Causal Inference. I will explain about the labs developed here:


[An inferential problem: The Gender Wage Gap](https://github.com/stephyriega/ML_CI/tree/main/An%20inferential%20problem%20The%20Gender%20Wage%20Gap)

We try to explian the the gender gap between a 

The data set we consider is from the March Supplement of the U.S. Current Population Survey, year 2015. The variable of interest Y is the hourly wage rate constructed as the ratio of the annual earnings to the total number of hours worked, which is constructed in turn as the product of number of weeks worked and the usual number of hours worked per week. In our analysis, we also focus on single (never married) workers. The use of the lasso for partialling-out the basic regressions shows us that the gender gap is of 12.14%, which is different from the 7% gap found int the basic regression using OLS. Probably because lasso supresses some of the regressors but not all of them, and because partialling out controls for the covariates in the both regressions. The use of the lasso for partialling-out the basic regressions shows us that the gender gap is of 11.40\%, which is different from the $7\%$ gap found int the basic regression using OLS but pretty similar to the 12\% found on the basic regression model with partialling-out. Above the possible reasons already mentioned, in this flexible model we have more regressors but also controlled by the penalty value. 





Overall, here is resume of the methods and models that were developed:


Methods available:
- Data splitting
- Partialling out
- Cross validation
- Boostraping

Models available:
- OLS (with RCT data)
- Lasso
- Dobble lasso
-
